> A test by jakmall.com for front end dev position

## Built with VueJS

A preface to the test:

I made this as a technical test for front end dev position at jakmall.com. I am using VueJs, SCSS, Node NPM for building the project.
I think the functionality is almost done. Only I haven't figure out how to keep state persist on refresh. I think about client local storage, but my time for the test is near end.

I learned alot during the process, so I want to thank jakmall.com for even giving me this test. And yes, I googled a lot too. There's so many things to be learned forward. Code in this project I believe is not that modular, but I'll keep practice to make the code modular, readable, and scalable.

Finally, thank you for giving me the chance to show my technical skill. I hope the best for both of us.

Cheers !
